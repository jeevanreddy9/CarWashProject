# CarWashProject
This Project is about creating a web based application for Mobile Car Wash. It is created using HTML and CSS frontend along with PYTHON backend.

I created login and register interfaces and its backend code.
The backend code is written in a online python compiler named Trinket. The following link will take you directly to my code. It can be best viewed when it is kept in full-screen.

Note: Try to give the execution commands asap since the database used, is an external server.

Please find the separate HTML codes for login and register pages and add the CSS code for styling of the pages.
